# Minecraft GPT Assistant

## Project Overview
This third-year project integrates OpenAI's GPT models into Minecraft, creating an assistant for answering player queries and providing insights within the game. Designed as a testbed, it explores the potential of AI to enhance interactive gaming environments. This mod allows for the evaluation and comparison of responses from different GPT models, offering insights into AI's utility in real-time strategy and decision-making within video games.

## Features
- **Vision-Based Queries**: Analyze in-game screenshots to provide contextual information about the environment, identify objects, and offer advice based on visual cues.
- **Textual Assistance**: Utilize natural language processing to answer queries related to game mechanics, crafting recipes, strategic advice, and general Minecraft knowledge.
- **Inventory Analysis**: Transforms the player's inventory into a textual format for comprehensive queries, facilitating sophisticated suggestions on item use, management, and crafting opportunities.
- **General Minecraft Queries**: Leverages the GPT model to answer wide-ranging questions about Minecraft, providing players with a deeper understanding and guidance without specific context requirements.
- **Dynamic Interaction**: Engages with the game world in real-time, offering solutions, hints, and entertainment, making each gameplay session unique and enriched with AI-powered insights.
- **Educational Insights**: Provides educational content on Minecraft's vast ecosystem, encouraging learning through play and exploration, powered by advanced AI models.
